However, it is impossible to arrange the number so that each square that shares a side sums to 2, since the smallest possible sum is 3 since all numbers appear once. Therefore, all the squares that share a side must sum to an odd prime number. Since this is the case, the squares that share a side cannot have the same parity. Since there are 5 odds and 4 evens we must place, the corners and the center must be odd, while the rest is even, as this is the only way to place the odd and even numbers so that no squares that share the same sides have the same parity. Notice that the center square shares a side with every single even number. Also note that 9 and 15 aren't primes, as they are all multiples of 3.\n</p><p>Case 1: Center number is 1\n</p><p>We can't place 8 anywhere, as 1+8=9\n</p><p>Case 2: Center number is 3\n</p><p>We can't place 6 anywhere, as 3+6=9\n</p><p>Case 3: Center number is 5\n</p><p>We can't place 4 anywhere, as 5+4=9\n</p><p>Case 4: Center number is 7\n</p><p>We can't place 2 anywhere, as 7+2=9\n</p><p>Case 5: Center number is 9\n</p><p>We can't place 6 anywhere, as 9+6=15\n</p><p>Since no number can be placed in the center, there are no such grids. We are done.\n</p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCached time: 20240908050949\nCache expiry: 86400\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.015 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.015 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 24/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 52/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/100\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 334/5000000 bytes\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n</div>\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key wiki-wiki_:pcache:idhash:25974-0!canonical and timestamp 20240908050948 and revision id 225346\n -->\n"
